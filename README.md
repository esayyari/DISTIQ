DISTIQUE is a forced acronym for Distance-based Inference of Species Trees using Induced QUartet Elements.

Its basic idea is to infer the species tree from gene trees by computing a distance between two species from the set of quartets that
include the two species. We have found ways to do this in a statistically consistent manner and are exploring ways to make this run in quadratic running time. 

The method is currenlty under development and evaluation. Stay tuned for more.
